# OctoPrint-BedLevelVisualizer

This plugin visualises the output from various firmware that support bed mesh leveling, noteably the Prusa `G81` mesh leveling report and the Marlin `G29 T` bed topography report. Please note that in order to use this plugin your 3D printer needs to support bed mesh leveling in software or come equipped with an auto level sensor supported by the printer's firmware (some entry-level printers do not provide such support per default). The plugin utilizes [Plotly](https://plot.ly/plotly-js-scientific-d3-charting-library/) js library to render a 3D surface of the bed's reported mesh on a tab within OctoPrint.

## Supported Firmware:

- Marlin
- PrusaFirmware
- Klipper
- Smoothieware

## Example

It converts this:

## Known Issues

- Install will fail silently in Python 3 due to missing system dependencies. You may have to SSH to your pi and run the command `sudo apt install libatlas3-base` to get the plugin to load.
- If installing on lower memory machines like the Orange Pi Zero or Raspberry Pi A numpy will have issues compiling. Check the instructions [here](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-BedLevelVisualizer/issues/141#issuecomment-542227338) for a potential solution.
- System Command Editor and Custom Control Editor plugins have a known issue [here](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-BedLevelVisualizer/issues/228) and [here](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-BedLevelVisualizer/issues/244) where your customizations for those plugins get wiped when used in conjunction with Bed Level Visualizer and a few other plugins. To avoid this from happening to you disable Bed Level Visualizer and after restarting OctoPrint configure your customizations in those plugins and save. Immediately disable those plugins and re-enable Bed Level Visualizer restart OctoPrint and Reload. Your customizations to controls and the system menu will still remain and the bug that exists in those plugins will be prevented from clearing your customizations. I highly recommend you take regular backups as well.
- Since version 0.1.3 there is a python dependency on numpy. As a result; if you don't already have numpy the install can take in excess of 30 minutes to complete on a pi. Just be patient and let it run and eventually the plugin install will finish.
- If your device have less than 512MB of ram your numpy installation will most likely fail. See [#141](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-BedLevelVisualizer/issues/141#issuecomment-542227338) for solution.
- If you have Marlin's Auto Temperature Reporting Feature enabled you will want to have M155 S30 and M155 S3 surrounding your G29 command, see settings screenshot, otherwise the collected data will be tainted.

## To-Do
- [ ] improve old marlin makergear support
- [x] improve rectangular mesh for circular bed calculations
- [x] ~~Pause standard OctoPrint temperature polling or squash the responses until processing is completed.~~ won't be possible, utilize M155 gcode if possible
- [x] ~~Orientation testing to verify axes are in correct direction.~~ added settings to allow controlling the orientation.
- [x] ~~Calculate bed dimensions and apply to probe points for display on graph, #28.~~
